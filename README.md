# Project Title

Python Django PostgreSQL application designed to add a social element to decluttering your home.

## Description

Users will be able to login and post items that they are unsure of getting rid of. Users can upload a picture of the item. Users can vote on other users' items - donate, trash, or keep. After time period TBD, user can update the community with the item status - whether they chose to take the community advice or not.  

Stretch Goal 1: Users can search for donation locations near them. Users can add Donation sites to the database. Users can leave reviews for donation sites.

Stretch Goal 2: Users can chat with each other and support each other through the decluttering process.
